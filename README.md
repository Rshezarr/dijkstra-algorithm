# Dijkstra Algorithm

This algorithm finds the shortest paths from one of the vertices of the graph to all the others

## Usage

The program accepts an adjacency matrix as two-dimensional array. Input your matrix in `table` variable, then start program by command:

```
$ make run
```

You will get the result in the array of each weight of the passed vertices

## Tools

-   GO (golang)
